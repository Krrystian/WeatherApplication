# WeatherApplication

Simple weather app project, to help me understand how JavaFX works. 
It shows current weather in your location. <br>
I collect location data using checkip website, so you don't need to type your current location everytime you open the app. <br>
If you want to change your location i added "settings" button to change it.<br>

## APIs:
- CHECK-IP [website] for IP address
- IP-API for location
- OpenWeatherMap for current weather
- NumbersApi from RapidAPI for date facts

## Why start with JavaFX instead of Swing?
Well, JavaFX is a newer framework to work with. That's why it was more appealing to use it instead of older Swing. <br>
Let's be honest... It's simpler to work with JavaFX and I recommend it if you want to make an app.

Installation is fairly simple. I believe all you need is
- JavaFX
